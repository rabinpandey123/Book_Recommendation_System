📚 Book Recommendation System

This is a complete Book Recommendation System built using Machine Learning techniques.

The system mainly implements:

Collaborative Filtering – recommends books by finding similarity between users and their preferences.

Popularity-Based Recommendation – suggests books based on overall ratings and popularity among users.

Both techniques are implemented in the code. The project is powered by Python Flask for deployment, and datasets are taken from Kaggle (also provided in this repository).
